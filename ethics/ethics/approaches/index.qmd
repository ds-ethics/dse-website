## Main idea

Data science ethics is often seen through the lenses of responsibility or bias. We add to this the moral practice approach.

## Theory warning

This post is very theoretical: *meta*-theoretical. It offers a hypothesis about the space of theories of data science ethics.

# Introduction

Suppose you could magically make one of three things happen.

1.  Data science will **get a code of ethics** and all data scientists will have to take a professional oath on this code.

2.  Data science will **solve bias**. Data scientists check their implicit biases, teams are more diverse, and data is more representative and inclusive.

3.  Data science will **champion reasoning**. Data scientists recognize ethical dilemmas, explain them, and work with others to solve them.

Each of these are good options. Here, I want to make a case for the third.

Each of these options stands for a different approach of data science ethics. Each is backed up by a different view of what kinds of ethical challenges data science raises. As such, each of the three options is a set of tools that fits with its respective view of the challenges. I call these three frameworks the *responsibility*, *bias*, and *practice* approach.

It's important to be clear about your approach for the ethics of data science. Depending on what kind of ethical challenges you think data science raises, you need to chose your tools appropriately.

Think hard on how you approach the ethics of data science. Depending on your approach, you will practice ethics of data science totally differently.

This module enables you to see the bigger picture in the ethics of data science. And to make your choice of tools more deliberately.

# Responsibility Approach

The first framework to the ethics of data science **centers on people**. It says that the general problem in the ethics of data science has to to with data scientists themselves. Data scientists lack a sense of responsibility.

Accordingly, proponents of this approach, such as Cathy O'Neil, argue that data scientists should take a professional oath. Such an oath, taken with the right intention, is a key part of building a sense a professional responsibility. Such oaths are familiar from other professions, such as medicine, engineering, or public administration. In short, some argue for a **care gap**: a lack of care, empathy, or concern causes irresponsible data science.

But care is not the only ingredient of responsibility. A sense of professional responsibility can be fostered in several ways. For starters, data scientists need to know how their work is used. After all, a lack of responsibility might be not only due to a lack of care or compassion, but also due a lack of knowledge. There might be a **information gap**: High technical complexity, large-scale division of labor, and ideologies cloud the view of what one is contributing to. This information obstacle stands in the way of responsible data science.

And it's not always easy to know, ahead of time, how a data science project will play out in practice. And even if we could, individuals can often make very little difference. That means: A sense of responsibility, to be effective, needs to be collectively shared and organized --- not an easy thing to do! There is thus, finally an **organization gap** in data science: responsible individuals lack the structures, places, and power to put responsibility into practice together.

The good news is: A lot is being done to build such a shared sense of responsibility in data science. It's hard for data scientists these days not to be confronted with the harms their work may cause. Data science degrees now regularly include education on ethics. And we see emerging legislation to create incentives for data science to care about ethical issues, such as the EU's AI Act. In this way, a sense of responsibility can be incentivised extrinsically, it must not emerge from the individuals or the profession.

In sum, the responsibility approach to the ethics of data science contends that the ethics of data science should be about people and how they organize themselves. The job of ethics, on this approach, is to make data scientists care and make them aware of the consequences of their work. The strategies to achieve this include ethics codes, professional oaths, interdisciplinary collaboration, collaborative governance, and regulation.

# Bias Approach

A second framework centers on bias---or rather: bias*es*, since bias comes in many different forms. I think it helps to distinguish at least two forms of bias: cognitive and structural.

The first important form of bias is **cognitive bias**, that is, problematic habits of thought, associations, or assumptions. The ethics of data science might be about the cognitive biases, or at least, the biases of its practitioners. As one prominent slogan goes: "All models are biased because humans are biased." 

::: aside 
What makes *some* biases problematic and some OK is a very tricky question. 
:::

In addition, an ethics of data science that focuses on bias may also proceed on a structural route. Here the focus is not on biases---implicit or explicit, cognitive or behavioral---of individuals but on the biases *reflected* in the data. Here the slogan could be that "all models are biased because reality is biased." That is, data represent the injustices and inequities that are out there in our very imperfect world. By the principle of garbage in and garbage out, data science then encodes these biases, entrenches them, or even makes them worse. **Structural bias**, i.e., problematic group level distributional differences of certain properties such as income, geography, or interaction with institutions, creeps into data science because these differences are captured by data.

Again, there is much to this picture of ethics as bias mitigation. Again, the lessons it imparts were painfully learned. As often with moral progress, society at large and the profession of data science in particular stand in the debt of minority scholars who took on the labor of pointing out what should be obvious; often failing to "get through," often belittled, discounted, or dismissed.

Data science has a lot to do with bias. But issues of bias are still at most one part of the ethics of data science. The ethics of data science is much broader than bias. For example, constructing a measure of "teacher effectiveness" raises methodological and ethical problems about what it means to be a good teacher, whether collecting the relevant data to measure this violates students' privacy --- issues that have little to do with cognitive or structural biases. Likewise, even paradigmatic examples of bias at work, such as predicting crime or recidivism (where historic injustice is clearly reflected in the data), have to do with more than bias, namely, with the power of the police or the legitimacy of pre-trial detention more broadly.

## Limits of "bias"

The ethics of data science is about much more than bias mitigation.
:::
:::

As the word "reflected" already suggests, **biases in data are often symptoms** of an underlying problem. They indicate more fundamental problems that cause or sustain biases. The **ethics of data science thus should speak to these underlying problems** and not only to the bias surfaced in data.

# Moral Practice Approach

I am personally drawn to a third approach. The ethics of data science should center on the practice of data science. The idea here is that data science is hard---not just technically but also morally. It involves moral dilemmas or **trade-offs that hide behind seemingly technical issues**. But the trade-offs are real and it does no good to hide them. The slogan of this third approach would be: "Data Science is a Moral Practice."

When training a model to predict welfare fraud, data scientists need to balance false positives and false negatives. What should be the "exchange rate" between such errors? Similarly, data scientists regularly face a trade-off between accuracy and fairness. This trade-off present itself, for example, in the question of whether, when wanting to predict recidivism, data on arrests for minor, non-violent offenses---where bias is particularly prominent---should be included.

That data science is a moral practice becomes particularly clear when we take data science to be much **more than data analysis**. Communication plays an important---and often neglected---role in data science. Ethical questions abound in communicating in data science and outside of data analysis more broadly. Are there some projects that a data science team must not take on? How should limits of a product be communicated? How much should be done to protect privacy?

The moral practice approach contends that you find such thorny questions at each step in the lifecycle of a data science project. Data scientists face moral dilemmas. That is, they face decisions to which moral considerations are relevant and these considerations pull in opposite directions. Each option has moral reasons in its favor but also against it. The moral practice approach to data science seeks to understand these dilemmas to allow data scientists---or anyone interested---to reason through these dilemmas together, to disagree better, and come to a decision on firmer ground.

Perhaps the time for the moral practice approach has not yet come. For one, bias and a lack of professional responsibility still pervade data science and all societies at large. As such, the responsibility and the bias approach are urgently needed --- they fit the problems that anyone in the profession faces. Moreover, in divided societies, the moral practice approach seems idealistic, naïve, or Panglossian. For it requires that decisions are made rationally, that individuals are willing to reason about their decisions, and that moral reasoning can play a role in deliberations. But is this form of deliberation possible today?

I think it is. The approach can work under the right conditions. Creating these conditions is up to every team leader. In fact, the **greatest threat to moral progress is cynicism**. I want to positively reject the cynicism behind the suggestion that "this approach is not going to work anyway."

Finally, the moral practice approach is one for the long term. Data science raises old issues---about privacy, justice, and knowledge---anew. These issues are not going away. By contrast, we can hope that the problems that are currently urgent, of problematic biases and a lacking professional responsibility, will be overcome with time.

# The Difference an Approach Makes

How you approach the ethics of data science is a big decision. To summarize, each approach has its own **view on what the problem is** that an ethics of data science addresses. Moreover, each approach comes with own **tools and strategies** that fit the respective problem --- and hence with things you need to learn and understand to practice data science ethics. On each of the three approaches, you'd focus on different things.

Even if the ethics of data science may be all about dilemmas, there is no real dilemma here. You can follow all three approaches at once --- at least in principle.

The point of this article is to allow you to choose your approach more deliberately. This article takes a step back and brings a broader landscape of approaches into view. Moreover, you may need to choose after all. Your time and resources are limited. Even if you could pursue all three approaches in principle, you'll probably have to choose what you really want to concentrate on in a given situation. I hope that this article clarifies the choice and helps you make the right one.
