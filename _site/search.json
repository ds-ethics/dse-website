As part of the course curriculum, students actively engage in organizing workshops and activities to enhance their practical skills and share their knowledge with others.\n \nThese student-led activities, such as the workshop on Tools for Data Science with R, serve as valuable opportunities for participants to gain hands-on experience and learn directly from their peers. The I2DS course encourages students to take the lead in organizing and delivering these workshops, fostering a collaborative learning environment.\n\n\n\n Go to I2DS Tools 2021"

    "text": "Who doesn’t remember their first love? In my case, in the coding world, my first love was Stata. I clearly remember my first job as a research assistant to Laura Atuesta. Learning Stata implied an important learning curve since this language was used in my university for my classes, my work, and research. I did my bachelor’s thesis with Stata, and, being honest, I just have great memories using Stata because it was the first time that I’ve feel capable of doing multiple things. There my curiosity for data science and coding started. However, like any other Story love (that may be doesn’t end well), I met R. I would say with this language my interest and passion for coding exploded. Since then, I stopped using Stata and fall in love completely for R. Syntaxis, open-source building community and the approach that you can have with this language are just one of the multiple reasons why I decided to keep learning with R. It doesn’t matter what happens, Stata will be always in the bottom of my heart and my first love since it was the first coding language that I learned.\nBecause of this and because I know that different people and scholars are using Stata and they are curious about what R offers, here is an essential guide of commands for doing some data wrangling, analysis, and running some models. Of course, I don’t cover plenty of things, but this is just to show the differences between using R and Stata. I’m sorry if I don’t use the new Stata approaches since I learned the version 11º or 12º and now the are in the 17º version, however, the commands still can be useful.\nWe are going to work a lot with the dplyrpackage. You need to load the package just once when you open your environment. If you have any question, please check our other material to start learning R. However, the best way to learn is try different approaches (;"
