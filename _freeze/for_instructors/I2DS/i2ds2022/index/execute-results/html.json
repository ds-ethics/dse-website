As part of the course curriculum, students actively engage in organizing workshops and activities to enhance their practical skills and share their knowledge with others.\n\n \n\nThese student-led activities, such as the workshop on Tools for Data Science with R, serve as valuable opportunities for participants to gain hands-on experience and learn directly from their peers. The I2DS course encourages students to take the lead in organizing and delivering these workshops, fostering a collaborative learning environment.\n\n\n\n\n<div>\n  <form action=\"https://intro-to-data-science-22-workshop.github.io\">\n    <button class=\"button_i2ds\" type=\"submit\">\n       <i class=\"fa-solid fa-screwdriver-wrench fa-2x\"></i></i> Go to I2DS Tools 2022\n    </button>\n  </form>\n</div>\n\n",
