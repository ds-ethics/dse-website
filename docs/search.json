    "text": "Main idea\n\n\n\nData science ethics is often seen through the frameworks of responsibility or bias. We add to this the moral practice framework.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheory warning\n\n\n\nThis module is very theoretical: meta-theoretical. It offers a hypothesis about the space of theories of data science ethics.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nSuppose you could magically make one of three things happen.\n\nData science will get a code of ethics and all data scientists will have to take a professional oath on this code.\nData science will solve bias. Data scientists check their implicit biases, teams are more diverse, and data is more representative and inclusive.\nData science will champion moral reasoning. Data scientists recognize ethical dilemmas, explain them, and work with others to solve them.\n\nEach of these are good options. Here, we want to make a case for the third.\nEach of these options stands for a different framework of data science ethics. Each is backed up by a different view of what kinds of ethical challenges data science raises. As such, each of the three options is a set of tools that fits with its respective view of the challenges. We call these three frameworks the responsibility, bias, and practice approach.\nIt’s important to be clear about your framework for the ethics of data science. Depending on what kind of ethical challenges you think data science raises, you need to chose your tools appropriately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nDepending on your framework, you do the ethics of data science differently.\n\n\nThis module enables you to see the bigger picture in the ethics of data science. And to make your choice of tools more deliberately.\n\n\nResponsibility Approach\nThe first framework to the ethics of data science centers on people. It says that the general problem in the ethics of data science has to to with data scientists themselves. Data scientists lack a sense of responsibility.\nAccordingly, proponents of this approach, such as Cathy O’Neill, argue that data scientists should take a professional oath. Such an oath, taken with the right intention, is a key part of building a sense a professional responsibility. Such oaths are familiar from other professions, such as medicine, engineering, or public administration.\nA sense of professional responsibility can be built in different ways. For starters, data scientists need to know about the consequences of their work. Data scientists might lack a sense of responsibility, not only because they don’t care enough, but because they don’t know enough. A high technical complexity, large-scale division of labor, and ideologies might cloud the view of the results of what one is contributing to. And it’s not always easy to know, ahead of time, how a data science project will play out in practice. And even if we could, an individuals can often make very little difference. That means: A sense of responsibility, to be effective, needs to be collectively shared and organized — not an easy thing to do!\nThe good news is: A lot is being done to build such a shared sense of responsibility in data science. It’s hard for data scientists these days not to be confronted with the harms their work may cause. Data science degrees now regularly include education on ethics. And we see emerging legislation to create incentives for data science to care about ethical issues, such as the EU’s AI Act. In this way, a sense of responsibility can be incentivised extrinsically, it must not emerge from the individuals or the profession.\nIn sum, the responsibility approach to the ethics of data science contends that the ethics of data science should be about people and how they organize themselves. The job of ethics, on this approach, is to make data scientists care and make them aware of the consequences of their work. The strategies to achieve this include ethics codes, professional oaths, interdisciplinary collaboration, collaborative governance, and regulation.\n\n\nBias Approach\nA second framework centers on bias—or rather: biases, since bias comes in many different forms. One important form of bias is cognitive. The ethics of data science might be about the cognitive biases, or at least, the biases of its practitioners. As one prominent slogan goes: “All models are biased because humans are biased.” In addition, an ethics of data science that focuses on bias may also proceed on a structural route. Here the focus is not on biases—implicit or explicit, cognitive or behavioral—of individuals but on the biases reflected in the data. Here the slogan could be that “all models are biased because reality is biased.” That is, data represents the injustices and inequities that are out there in our very imperfect world. By the principle of garbage in and garbage out, data science then encodes these biases, entrenches them, or even makes them worse.\nAgain, there is much to this picture. Again, the lessons it imparts were painfully learned. As often with moral progress, society at large and the profession of data science in particular stand in the debt of minority scholars who took on the labor of pointing out what should be obvious. Often failing to “get through,” often belittled, discounted, or dismissed.\nData science has a lot to do with bias. But issues of bias are still at most one part of the ethics of data science. Constructing a measure of “teacher effectiveness” (e.g. as difference of average grades over time), raises methodological and ethical problems that have only little to do with cognitive or structural biases. Likewise, predicting crime or recidivism is beset with biases; but the ethical problems might have to do with the power of the police or the legitimacy of pre-trial detention more broadly than the historic injustice that is reflected in the data.\nAs the word “reflected” already suggests, biases in the data are often not themselves the problem but are indicative or are evidence for the problems that lead to these biases in the first place. The ethics of data science thus should speak to these underlying issues and not only to the bias surfaced in data.\n\n\nMoral Practice Approach\nWe are partial to a third answer. The ethics of data science should center on the practice of data science. Data science is hard—not just technically but also morally. It involves moral dilemmas. These dilemmas often hide behind seemingly technical issues. But the dilemmas are real and it does not good to hide them. In other words: “Data Science is a Moral Practice” is the slogan of this third approach.\nWhen training a model to predict welfare fraud, data scientists need to balance false positives and false negatives. What should be the “exchange rate” between such errors? Similarly, data scientists regularly face a trade-off between accuracy and fairness. This trade-off present itself, for example, in the question of whether, when wanting to predict recidivism, data on arrests for minor, non-violent offenses—where bias is particularly prominent—should be included.\nThat data science is a moral practice becomes particularly clear when we take data science to be much more than data analysis. Communication plays an important—and often neglected—role in data science. Ethical questions abound in communicating in data science and outside of data analysis more broadly. Are there some projects that a data science team must not take on? How should limits of a product be communicated? How much should be done to protect privacy?\nThe moral practice approach contends that you find such thorny questions at each step in the lifecycle of a data science project. Data scientists face moral dilemmas. That is, they face decisions to which moral considerations are relevant and these considerations pull in opposite directions. Each option has moral reasons in its favor but also against it. The moral practice approach to data science seeks to understand these dilemmas to allow data scientists—or anyone interested—to reason through these dilemmas together, to disagree better, and come to a decision on firmer ground.\nPerhaps the time for the moral practice approach has not yet come. For one, bias and a lack of professional responsibility still pervade data science and all societies at large. As such, we urgently need both the responsibility and the bias approach to the ethics of data science. Moreover, the current social and political environment seems rather inhospitable to an open discourse and moral reasoning. The moral practice approach, however, assumes that decisions are made rationally, that individuals are willing to reason about their decisions, and that moral reasoning can play a role in deliberations. Its assumptions hence seem idealistic, naïve, or Panglossian.\nWe disagree. Moral reasoning can work under the right conditions. It is up to every leader to create these conditions. And we positively reject the cynicism behind the suggestion that “this is not going to work anyway.” Moreover, this is a book for the long term. Data science raises old issues—about privacy, justice, and knowledge—anew. These issues are not going away. By contrast, we can hope that the problems that are currently urgent, of problematic biases and a lacking professional responsibility, will be overcome with time.\n\n\nThe Difference a Framework Makes\nHow you approach the ethics of data science is a big decision. Each approach comes with own set of strategies or processes — and things you need to learn and understand.\nHere are some of the different things you would do on each of the three frameworks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponsibility\nBias\nMoral Practice\n\n\n\n\n\nprofessional oath\nawareness of harms caused by data science projects\nethics codes\n\n\nrepresentative data collection\ntests for construct validity to avoid biased proxy variables\nteam diversity\ntraining and nudging against (implicit) cognitive bias\n\n\nmoral vocabulary\ncommunication skills\nmoral reasoning\nresearch ethics\n\n\n\n\nThe three frameworks are not exclusive in principle. But given realistic limitations you’ll have to prioritize which framework to follow in a given situation."

As part of the course curriculum, students actively engage in organizing workshops and activities to enhance their practical skills and share their knowledge with others.\n \nThese student-led activities, such as the workshop on Tools for Data Science with R, serve as valuable opportunities for participants to gain hands-on experience and learn directly from their peers. The I2DS course encourages students to take the lead in organizing and delivering these workshops, fostering a collaborative learning environment.\n\n\n\n Go to I2DS Tools 2022"

    "text": "Welcome to the “Ethics” section of “Data Science X Ethics,” where we delve deep into the heart of responsible innovation and the ethical use of data and technology. In the rapidly evolving landscape of data science, ethical considerations are not just an add-on; they are foundational to creating technology that serves humanity with respect and integrity.\nThis section is dedicated to exploring the complex ethical questions that arise in the field of data science. It’s here that we confront the challenges of balancing innovation with privacy, algorithmic fairness with efficiency, and the pursuit of knowledge with respect for individual rights. Our goal is to provide you with insights, resources, and thought-provoking content that illuminate the ethical dimensions of working with data."

And you know that online advertisers track you. And you know that you signed something at your doctor’s office about sharing your patient data.\nBut often, privacy today is violated unwittingly. For one, it’s basically impossible to be aware of all the ways in which your data is collected, analyzed, and shared. Similarly, nobody can possibly read all the terms and conditions and privacy policies that they are agreeing to.\nIn short, there is an information problem: Individuals don’t know — and, to some extent, cannot know — all they need to know to safeguard their privacy. And, arguably, we shouldn’t spend much of our time and mental energy on protecting our privacy."

The options that we have to protect our privacy, even when we are aware of them, is practically limited. Metadata collection that is required by law is hard to opt out of. Even tech-savvy individuals are outgunned by the professional data, surveillance, and security industry.\nAnd then, we also have a cognitive system that is easy to exploit. As such, websites and apps use various forms of deception to get you to do things.1 You end up subscribing to a service without knowing, agreeing to terms without having read them, or clicking “Continue” because the other button, “No,” was made hard to see.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeceptive design\n\n\nIn sum, privacy is inadvertently infringed on a regular basis in two respects\n\nIndividuals hold false beliefs about the state of their privacy and the options in front of them\nIndividuals have limited options to safeguard their privacy\n\nThese two points are practically necessary. That is, given how things are, these are two starting points that we cannot change. You can only read so many terms and conditions, if you can read any, and there is only so much you can do."
